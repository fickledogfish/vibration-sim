# Contributing

So, you found this project, used it for a while and thought it would
be useful to have this or that feature.

Maybe you don't know enough `Clojure` or `play-clj` to code this
feature, or maybe you do, and made the necessary changes. In any case,
you are more than welcome to contact me! (But, please, prefer to use
Git Hub or Twitter.)

## Bug reports

First, check that you are using the program from the `master` branch.
Anything in `unsafe-dev` or in any experimental branch is, sometimes,
expected not to work.

Then, gather as much information as possible when reporting; things
to keep in mind include:

* operating system;
* version of the java platform;
* screenshots, in case of visual bugs;
* console output.

With all of this in hand, I'll try to fix the described problem as
soon as I can.

## Suggestions

Suggestions of every kind are more than welcome. I built this only
for fun, but someone may find it useful someday.

Please keep in mind new features may or may not be implemented; and, if
they are, they may take a while.

If possible, send me a justification for new features and describe
them in every possible detail you thought.

## New code

Development is done in `unsafe-dev` branch; experimental features that
may not be useful will have their own branch and, in both cases, the
program is not guaranteed to work. Whenever possible, use these
branches when developing. Also, make sure to use the latest version of
the program.
